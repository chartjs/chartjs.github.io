Detailed installation instructions can be found on the installation page. Creating a Chart It's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single node to render the chart. In this example, we create a bar chart for a single dataset and render that in our page. You can see all the ways to use Chart.js in the usage documentation. var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d'); var myChart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'bar', data: { labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'], datasets: [{ label: '# of Votes', data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3], backgroundColor: [ 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)', 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)', 'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)', 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)', 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)', 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)' ], borderColor: [ 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)', 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)', 'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)', 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)', 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)', 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)' ], borderWidth: 1 }] }, options: { scales: { y: { beginAtZero: true } } } }); Contributing Before submitting an issue or a pull request to the project, please take a moment to look over the contributing guidelines first.

Creating a Chart To create a chart, we need to instantiate the Chart class. To do this, we need to pass in the node, jQuery instance, or 2d context of the canvas of where we want to draw the chart. Here's an example. // Any of the following formats may be used var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart'); var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d'); var ctx = $('#myChart'); var ctx = 'myChart'; Once you have the element or context, you're ready to instantiate a pre-defined chart-type or create your own!

Chart.js 2.0 was released in April 2016. In the years since then, as Chart.js has grown in popularity and feature set, we've learned some lessons about how to better create a charting library. In order to improve performance, offer new features, and improve maintainability, it was necessary to break backwards compatibility, but we aimed to do so only when worth the benefit. Some major highlights of v3 include: Large performance improvements including the ability to skip data parsing and render charts in parallel via webworkers Additional configurability and scriptable options with better defaults Completely rewritten animation system Rewritten filler plugin with numerous bug fixes API Documentation generated and verified by TypeScript No more CSS injection Tons of bug fixes End user migration Setup and installation Chart.js is no longer providing the Chart.bundle.js and Chart.bundle.min.js. Please see the installation and integration docs for details on the recommended way to setup Chart.js if you were using these builds. moment is no longer specified as an npm dependency. If you are using the time scale, you must include one of the available adapters and corresponding date library. You no longer need to exclude moment from your build. Options A number of changes were made to the configuration options passed to the Chart constructor. Those changes are documented below. hover.animationDuration is now configured in animation.active.duration responsiveAnimationDuration is now configured in animation.resize.duration Polar area startAngle option is now consistent with Radar, 0 is at top and value is in degrees. Default is changed from -½π to 0. scales.[x/y]Axes arrays were removed. Scales are now configured directly to options.scales object with the object key being the scale Id. scales.[x/y]Axes.barPercentage was moved to dataset option barPercentage scales.[x/y]Axes.barThickness was moved to dataset option barThickness scales.[x/y]Axes.categoryPercentage was moved to dataset option categoryPercentage scales.[x/y]Axes.maxBarThickness was moved to dataset option maxBarThickness scales.[x/y]Axes.minBarLength was moved to dataset option minBarLength scales.[x/y]Axes.ticks.beginAtZero was renamed to scales[id].beginAtZero scales.[x/y]Axes.ticks.max was renamed to scales[id].max scales.[x/y]Axes.ticks.min was renamed to scales[id].min scales.[x/y]Axes.ticks.reverse was renamed to scales[id].reverse scales.[x/y]Axes.ticks.suggestedMax was renamed to scales[id].suggestedMax scales.[x/y]Axes.ticks.suggestedMin was renamed to scales[id].suggestedMin scales.[x/y]Axes.ticks.unitStepSize was removed.

Use scriptable scale options instead. The dataset option steppedLine was removed. Use stepped The dataset option tension was removed. Use lineTension Dataset options are now configured as options[type].datasets rather than options.datasets[type] To override the platform class used in a chart instance, pass platform: PlatformClass in the config object. Note that the class should be passed, not an instance of the class. Defaults global namespace was removed from defaults. So Chart.defaults.global is now Chart.defaults default prefix was removed from defaults. For example Chart.defaults.global.defaultColor is now Chart.defaults.color defaultColor was renamed to color defaultFontColor was renamed to fontColor defaultFontFamily was renamed to fontFamily defaultFontSize was renamed to fontSize defaultFontStyle was renamed to fontStyle defaultLineHeight was renamed to lineHeight Scales The configuration options for scales is the largest change in v3. The xAxes and yAxes arrays were removed and axis options are individual scales now keyed by scale ID. The v2 configuration below is shown with it's new v3 configuration options: { scales: { xAxes: [{ id: 'x', type: 'time', display: true, scaleLabel: { display: true, labelString: 'Date' }, ticks: { major: { enabled: true }, fontStyle: function(context) { return context.tick && context.tick.major ?

"},"general/responsive.html":{"url":"general/responsive.html","title":"Responsive","keywords":"","body":"Responsive Charts When it comes to changing the chart size based on the window size, a major limitation is that the canvas render size (canvas.width and .height) can not be expressed with relative values, contrary to the display size (canvas.style.width and .height). Furthermore, these sizes are independent from each other and thus the canvas render size does not adjust automatically based on the display size, making the rendering inaccurate. The following examples do not work: : invalid values, the canvas doesn't resize (example) : invalid behavior, the canvas is resized but becomes blurry (example) Chart.js provides a few options to enable responsiveness and control the resize behavior of charts by detecting when the canvas display size changes and update the render size accordingly. Configuration Options Name Type Default Description responsive boolean true Resizes the chart canvas when its container does (important note...). maintainAspectRatio boolean true Maintain the original canvas aspect ratio (width / height) when resizing. aspectRatio number 2 Canvas aspect ratio (i.e. width / height, a value of 1 representing a square canvas). Note that this option is ignored if the height is explicitly defined either as attribute or via the style. onResize function null Called when a resize occurs. Gets passed two arguments: the chart instance and the new size. Important Note Detecting when the canvas size changes can not be done directly from the canvas element. Chart.js uses its parent container to update the canvas render and display sizes. However, this method requires the container to be relatively positioned and dedicated to the chart canvas only. Responsiveness can then be achieved by setting relative values for the container size (example): The chart can also be programmatically resized by modifying the container size: chart.canvas.parentNode.style.height = '128px'; chart.canvas.parentNode.style.width = '128px'; Note that in order for the above code to correctly resize the chart height, the maintainAspectRatio option must also be set to false. Printing Resizeable Charts CSS media queries allow changing styles when printing a page. The CSS applied from these media queries may cause charts to need to resize. However, the resize won't happen automatically. To support resizing charts when printing, one needs to hook the onbeforeprint event and manually trigger resizing of each chart. function beforePrintHandler () { for (var id in Chart.instances) { Chart.instances[id].resize(); } } "},"general/device-pixel-ratio.html":{"url":"general/device-pixel-ratio.html","title":"Pixel Ratio","keywords":"","body":"Device Pixel Ratio By default the chart's canvas will use a 1:1 pixel ratio, unless the physical display has a higher pixel ratio (e.g. Retina displays).

The nearest item is determined based on the distance to the center of the chart item (point, bar). You can use the axis setting to define which directions are used in distance calculation. If intersect is true, this is only triggered when the mouse position intersects an item in the graph. This is very useful for combo charts where points are hidden behind bars. var chart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data, options: { tooltips: { mode: 'nearest' } } }); index Finds item at the same index.

You can specify the color as a string in hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL notations. If a color is needed, but not specified, Chart.js will use the global default color. This color is stored at Chart.defaults.color. It is initially set to 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'. You can also pass a CanvasGradient object. You will need to create this before passing to the chart, but using it you can achieve some interesting effects. Patterns and Gradients An alternative option is to pass a CanvasPattern or CanvasGradient object instead of a string colour. For example, if you wanted to fill a dataset with a pattern from an image you could do the following. var img = new Image(); img.src = 'https://example.com/my_image.png'; img.onload = function() { var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d'); var fillPattern = ctx.createPattern(img, 'repeat'); var chart = new Chart(ctx, { data: { labels: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'], datasets: [{ data: [10, 20, 30], backgroundColor: fillPattern }] } }); }; Using pattern fills for data graphics can help viewers with vision deficiencies (e.g. color-blindness or partial sight) to more easily understand your data. Using the Patternomaly library you can generate patterns to fill datasets. var chartData = { datasets: [{ data: [45, 25, 20, 10], backgroundColor: [ pattern.draw('square', '#ff6384'), pattern.draw('circle', '#36a2eb'), pattern.draw('diamond', '#cc65fe'), pattern.draw('triangle', '#ffce56') ] }], labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Purple', 'Yellow'] }; "},"general/fonts.html":{"url":"general/fonts.html","title":"Fonts","keywords":"","body":"Fonts There are 4 special global settings that can change all of the fonts on the chart. These options are in Chart.defaults. The global font settings only apply when more specific options are not included in the config.

Chart.defaults.fontColor = 'red'; let chart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data, options: { legend: { labels: { // This more specific font property overrides the global property fontColor: 'black' } } } }); Name Type Default Description fontColor Color '#666' Default font color for all text. fontFamily string \"'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif\" Default font family for all text. fontSize number 12 Default font size (in px) for text.

"},"general/performance.html":{"url":"general/performance.html","title":"Performance","keywords":"","body":"Performance Chart.js charts are rendered on canvas elements, which makes rendering quite fast. For large datasets or performance sensitive applications, you may wish to consider the tips below. Tick Calculation Rotation Specify a rotation value by setting minRotation and maxRotation to the same value, which avoids the chart from having to automatically determine a value to use. Sampling Set the ticks.sampleSize option. This will determine how large your labels are by looking at only a subset of them in order to render axes more quickly. This works best if there is not a large variance in the size of your labels. Disable Animations If your charts have long render times, it is a good idea to disable animations. Doing so will mean that the chart needs to only be rendered once during an update instead of multiple times. This will have the effect of reducing CPU usage and improving general page performance. To disable animations new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data, options: { animation: false } }); Provide ordered data If the data is unordered, Chart.js needs to sort it. This can be slow in some cases, so its always a good idea to provide ordered data. Specify min and max for scales If you specify the min and max, the scale does not have to compute the range from the data. new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data, options: { scales: { x: { type: 'time', min: new Date('2019-01-01').valueOf(), max: new Date('2019-12-31').valueOf() }, y: { type: 'linear', min: 0, max: 100 } } } }); Data structure and format Provide prepared data in the internal format accepted by the dataset and scales and set parsing: false. See Data structures for more information. Data Decimation Decimating your data will achieve the best results. When there is a lot of data to display on the graph, it doesn't make sense to show tens of thousands of data points on a graph that is only a few hundred pixels wide. There are many approaches to data decimation and selection of an algorithm will depend on your data and the results you want to achieve. For instance, min/max decimation will preserve peaks in your data but could require up to 4 points for each pixel. This type of decimation would work well for a very noisy signal where you need to see data peaks. Line charts are able to do automatic data decimation during draw, when certain conditions are met. You should still consider decimating data yourself before passing it in for maximum performance since the automatic decimation occurs late in the chart life cycle. Render Chart.js in a web worker (Chrome only) Chome (in version 69) added the ability to transfer rendering control of a canvas to a web worker. Web workers can use the OffscreenCanvas API to render from a web worker onto canvases in the DOM. Chart.js is a canvas-based library and supports rendering in a web worker - just pass an OffscreenCanvas into the Chart constructor instead of a Canvas element. Note that as of today, this API is only supported in Chrome. By moving all Chart.js calculations onto a separate thread, the main thread can be freed up for other uses. Some tips and tricks when using Chart.js in a web worker: Transferring data between threads can be expensive, so ensure that your config and data objects are as small as possible. Try generating them on the worker side if you can (workers can make HTTP requests!) or passing them to your worker as ArrayBuffers, which can be transferred quickly from one thread to another. You can't transfer functions between threads, so if your config object includes functions you'll have to strip them out before transferring and then add them back later. You can't access the DOM from worker threads, so Chart.js plugins that use the DOM (including any mouse interactions) will likely not work. Ensure that you have a fallback if you support browsers other than the most modern Chrome browser. Resizing the chart must be done manually. See an example in the worker code below. Example main thread code: const config = {}; const canvas = new HTMLCanvasElement(); const offscreenCanvas = canvas.transferControlToOffscreen(); const worker = new Worker('worker.js'); worker.postMessage({canvas: offscreenCanvas, config}, [offscreenCanvas]); Example worker code, in worker.js: onmessage = function(event) { const {canvas, config} = event.data; const chart = new Chart(canvas, config); // Resizing the chart must be done manually, since OffscreenCanvas does not include event listeners. canvas.width = 100; canvas.height = 100; chart.resize(); }; Line Charts Disable Bezier Curves If you are drawing lines on your chart, disabling bezier curves will improve render times since drawing a straight line is more performant than a bezier curve. To disable bezier curves for an entire chart: new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data, options: { elements: { line: { tension: 0 // disables bezier curves } } } }); Automatic data decimation during draw Line element will automatically decimate data, when the following conditions are met: tension is 0, stepped is false (default) and borderDash is [] (default).` This improves rendering speed by skipping drawing of invisible line segments. new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data, options: { elements: { line: { tension: 0, // disables bezier curves fill: false, stepped: false, borderDash: [] } } } }); Enable spanGaps If you have a lot of data points, it can be more performant to enable spanGaps. This disables segmentation of the line, which can be an unneeded step. To enable spanGaps: new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: { datasets: [{ spanGaps: true // enable for a single dataset }] }, options: { spanGaps: true // enable for all datasets } }); Disable Line Drawing If you have a lot of data points, it can be more performant to disable rendering of the line for a dataset and only draw points. Doing this means that there is less to draw on the canvas which will improve render performance. To disable lines: new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: { datasets: [{ showLine: false // disable for a single dataset }] }, options: { showLines: false // disable for all datasets } }); Disable Point Drawing If you have a lot of data points, it can be more performant to disable rendering of the points for a dataset and only draw line. Doing this means that there is less to draw on the canvas which will improve render performance. To disable point drawing: new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: { datasets: [{ pointRadius: 0 // disable for a single dataset }] }, options: { datasets: { line: { pointRadius: 0 // disable for all `'line'` datasets } }, elements: { point: { radius: 0 // default to disabled in all datasets } } } }); "},"configuration/":{"url":"configuration/","title":"Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Configuration The configuration is used to change how the chart behaves. There are properties to control styling, fonts, the legend, etc. Global Configuration This concept was introduced in Chart.js 1.0 to keep configuration DRY, and allow for changing options globally across chart types, avoiding the need to specify options for each instance, or the default for a particular chart type. Chart.js merges the options object passed to the chart with the global configuration using chart type defaults and scales defaults appropriately. This way you can be as specific as you would like in your individual chart configuration, while still changing the defaults for all chart types where applicable. The global general options are defined in Chart.defaults. The defaults for each chart type are discussed in the documentation for that chart type. The following example would set the hover mode to 'nearest' for all charts where this was not overridden by the chart type defaults or the options passed to the constructor on creation. Chart.defaults.hover.mode = 'nearest'; // Hover mode is set to nearest because it was not overridden here var chartHoverModeNearest = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data }); // This chart would have the hover mode that was passed in var chartDifferentHoverMode = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data, options: { hover: { // Overrides the global setting mode: 'index' } } }); Dataset Configuration Options may be configured directly on the dataset. The dataset options can be changed at 3 different levels and are evaluated with the following priority: per dataset: dataset.* per chart: options[type].datasets.* or globally: Chart.defaults[type].datasets.* where type corresponds to the dataset type. Note: dataset options take precedence over element options. The following example would set the showLine option to 'false' for all line datasets except for those overridden by options passed to the dataset on creation. // Do not show lines for all datasets by default Chart.defaults.datasets.line.showLine = false; // This chart would show a line only for the third dataset var chart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: { datasets: [{ data: [0, 0], }, { data: [0, 1] }, { data: [1, 0], showLine: true // overrides the `line` dataset default }, { type: 'scatter', // 'line' dataset default does not affect this dataset since it's a 'scatter' data: [1, 1] }] } }); "},"configuration/animations.html":{"url":"configuration/animations.html","title":"Animations","keywords":"","body":"Animations Chart.js animates charts out of the box.

We could change the click handler accordingly. var defaultLegendClickHandler = Chart.defaults.legend.onClick; var newLegendClickHandler = function (e, legendItem) { var index = legendItem.datasetIndex; if (index > 1) { // Do the original logic defaultLegendClickHandler(e, legendItem); } else { let ci = this.chart; [ ci.getDatasetMeta(0), ci.getDatasetMeta(1) ].forEach(function(meta) { meta.hidden = meta.hidden === null ? !ci.data.datasets[index].hidden : null; }); ci.update(); } }; var chart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data, options: { legend: { onClick: newLegendClickHandler } } }); Now when you click the legend in this chart, the visibility of the first two datasets will be linked together.

Same goes for left and right in horizontal chart. Options are: 'bottom' 'left' 'top' 'right' false borderWidth If this value is a number, it is applied to all sides of the rectangle (left, top, right, bottom), except borderSkipped.

Dataset Configuration The bar chart accepts the following configuration from the associated dataset options: Name Type Default Description barPercentage number 0.9 Percent (0-1) of the available width each bar should be within the category width. 1.0 will take the whole category width and put the bars right next to each other. more... categoryPercentage number 0.8 Percent (0-1) of the available width each category should be within the sample width. more... barThickness number|string Manually set width of each bar in pixels. If set to 'flex', it computes \"optimal\" sample widths that globally arrange bars side by side. If not set (default), bars are equally sized based on the smallest interval. more... maxBarThickness number Set this to ensure that bars are not sized thicker than this. minBarLength number Set this to ensure that bars have a minimum length in pixels. Example Usage data: { datasets: [{ barPercentage: 0.5, barThickness: 6, maxBarThickness: 8, minBarLength: 2, data: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70] }] }; barThickness If this value is a number, it is applied to the width of each bar, in pixels. When this is enforced, barPercentage and categoryPercentage are ignored. If set to 'flex', the base sample widths are calculated automatically based on the previous and following samples so that they take the full available widths without overlap. Then, bars are sized using barPercentage and categoryPercentage. There is no gap when the percentage options are 1. This mode generates bars with different widths when data are not evenly spaced. If not set (default), the base sample widths are calculated using the smallest interval that prevents bar overlapping, and bars are sized using barPercentage and categoryPercentage. This mode always generates bars equally sized. Scale Configuration The bar chart sets unique default values for the following configuration from the associated scale options: Name Type Default Description offset boolean true If true, extra space is added to the both edges and the axis is scaled to fit into the chart area. gridLines.offsetGridLines boolean true If true, the bars for a particular data point fall between the grid lines. The grid line will move to the left by one half of the tick interval. If false, the grid line will go right down the middle of the bars. more... Example Usage options = { scales: { x: { gridLines: { offsetGridLines: true } } } }; offsetGridLines If true, the bars for a particular data point fall between the grid lines. The grid line will move to the left by one half of the tick interval, which is the space between the grid lines. If false, the grid line will go right down the middle of the bars. This is set to true for a category scale in a bar chart while false for other scales or chart types by default. Default Options It is common to want to apply a configuration setting to all created bar charts. The global bar chart settings are stored in Chart.defaults.bar. Changing the global options only affects charts created after the change. Existing charts are not changed. barPercentage vs categoryPercentage The following shows the relationship between the bar percentage option and the category percentage option. // categoryPercentage: 1.0 // barPercentage: 1.0 Bar: | 1.0 | 1.0 | Category: | 1.0 | Sample: |===========| // categoryPercentage: 1.0 // barPercentage: 0.5 Bar: |.5| |.5| Category: | 1.0 | Sample: |==============| // categoryPercentage: 0.5 // barPercentage: 1.0 Bar: |1.||1.| Category: | .5 | Sample: |==============| Data Structure All of the supported data structures can be used with bar charts.

They are used to determine how data maps to a pixel value on the chart. In a cartesian chart, there is 1 or more X axis and 1 or more Y axis to map points onto the 2 dimensional canvas. These axes are known as 'cartesian axes'. In a radial chart, such as a radar chart or a polar area chart, there is a single axis that maps points in the angular and radial directions. These are known as 'radial axes'. Scales in Chart.js >v2.0 are significantly more powerful, but also different than those of v1.0. Multiple X & Y axes are supported. A built-in label auto-skip feature detects would-be overlapping ticks and labels and removes every nth label to keep things displaying normally. Scale titles are supported. New scale types can be extended without writing an entirely new chart type. Common Configuration The following properties are common to all axes provided by Chart.js.

Updating Axis Defaults The default configuration for a scale can be easily changed using the scale service. All you need to do is to pass in a partial configuration that will be merged with the current scale default configuration to form the new default. For example, to set the minimum value of 0 for all linear scales, you would do the following. Any linear scales created after this time would now have a minimum of 0.

To position the axis at the edge of the chart, set the position option to one of: 'top', 'left', 'bottom', 'right'. To position the axis at the center of the chart area, set the position option to 'center'. In this mode, either the axis option is specified or the axis ID starts with the letter 'x' or 'y'. To position the axis with respect to a data value, set the position option to an object such as: { x: -20 } This will position the axis at a value of -20 on the axis with ID \"x\".

See Moment.js for the allowable format strings. Name Default Example millisecond 'h:mm:ss.SSS a' '11:20:01.123 AM' second 'h:mm:ss a' '11:20:01 AM' minute 'h:mm a' '11:20 AM' hour 'hA' '11AM' day 'MMM D' 'Sep 4' week 'll' 'Sep 4 2015' month 'MMM YYYY' 'Sep 2015' quarter '[Q]Q - YYYY' 'Q3 - 2015' year 'YYYY' '2015' For example, to set the display format for the quarter unit to show the month and year, the following config would be passed to the chart constructor. var chart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data, options: { scales: { x: { type: 'time', time: { displayFormats: { quarter: 'MMM YYYY' } } } } } }); Scale Distribution The distribution property controls the data distribution along the scale: 'linear': data are spread according to their time (distances can vary) 'series': data are spread at the same distance from each other var chart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'line', data: data, options: { scales: { x: { type: 'time', distribution: 'series' } } } }); When the scale is in series mode, the data indices are expected to be unique, sorted, and consistent across datasets. Scale Bounds The bounds property controls the scale boundary strategy (bypassed by min/max time options). 'data': makes sure data are fully visible, labels outside are removed 'ticks': makes sure ticks are fully visible, data outside are truncated Ticks Source The ticks.source property controls the ticks generation. 'auto': generates \"optimal\" ticks based on scale size and time options 'data': generates ticks from data (including labels from data {t|x|y} objects) 'labels': generates ticks from user given labels ONLY Parser If this property is defined as a string, it is interpreted as a custom format to be used by Moment.js to parse the date. If this is a function, it must return a Moment.js object given the appropriate data value.

As the name suggests, linear interpolation is used to determine where a value lies in relation the center of the axis. The following additional configuration options are provided by the radial linear scale. Configuration Options The axis has configuration properties for ticks, angle lines (line that appear in a radar chart outward from the center), pointLabels (labels around the edge in a radar chart).

Axis Range Settings Given the number of axis range settings, it is important to understand how they all interact with each other. The suggestedMax and suggestedMin settings only change the data values that are used to scale the axis. These are useful for extending the range of the axis while maintaining the auto fit behaviour. let minDataValue = Math.min(mostNegativeValue, options.ticks.suggestedMin); let maxDataValue = Math.max(mostPositiveValue, options.ticks.suggestedMax); In this example, the largest positive value is 50, but the data maximum is expanded out to 100. However, because the lowest data value is below the suggestedMin setting, it is ignored. let chart = new Chart(ctx, { type: 'radar', data: { datasets: [{ label: 'First dataset', data: [0, 20, 40, 50] }], labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April'] }, options: { scale: { suggestedMin: 50, suggestedMax: 100 } } }); In contrast to the suggested* settings, the min and max settings set explicit ends to the axes. When these are set, some data points may not be visible. Step Size If set, the scale ticks will be enumerated by multiple of stepSize, having one tick per increment. If not set, the ticks are labeled automatically using the nice numbers algorithm. This example sets up a chart with a y axis that creates ticks at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5. let options = { scale: { max: 5, min: 0, ticks: { stepSize: 0.5 } } }; Angle Line Options The following options are used to configure angled lines that radiate from the center of the chart to the point labels. They can be found in the angleLines sub options.

These are available on all charts created with Chart.js, but for the examples, let's use a line chart we've made. // For example: var myLineChart = new Chart(ctx, config); .destroy() Use this to destroy any chart instances that are created. This will clean up any references stored to the chart object within Chart.js, along with any associated event listeners attached by Chart.js. This must be called before the canvas is reused for a new chart. // Destroys a specific chart instance myLineChart.destroy(); .update(mode) Triggers an update of the chart. This can be safely called after updating the data object. This will update all scales, legends, and then re-render the chart. myLineChart.data.datasets[0].data[2] = 50; // Would update the first dataset's value of 'March' to be 50 myLineChart.update(); // Calling update now animates the position of March from 90 to 50. Note: replacing the data reference (e.g. myLineChart.data = {datasets: [...]} only works starting version 2.6. Prior that, replacing the entire data object could be achieved with the following workaround: myLineChart.config.data = {datasets: [...]}. A mode string can be provided to indicate what should be updated and what animation configuration should be used. Core calls this method using any of 'active', 'hide', 'reset', 'resize', 'show' or undefined. 'none' is also a supported mode for skipping animations for single update. Please see animations docs for more details. Example: myChart.update(); See Updating Charts for more details. .reset() Reset the chart to it's state before the initial animation. A new animation can then be triggered using update. myLineChart.reset(); .render() Triggers a redraw of all chart elements. Note, this does not update elements for new data. Use .update() in that case. .stop() Use this to stop any current animation. This will pause the chart during any current animation frame. Call .render() to re-animate. // Stops the charts animation loop at its current frame myLineChart.stop(); // => returns 'this' for chainability .resize() Use this to manually resize the canvas element. This is run each time the canvas container is resized, but you can call this method manually if you change the size of the canvas nodes container element. // Resizes & redraws to fill its container element myLineChart.resize(); // => returns 'this' for chainability .clear() Will clear the chart canvas. Used extensively internally between animation frames, but you might find it useful. // Will clear the canvas that myLineChart is drawn on myLineChart.clear(); // => returns 'this' for chainability .toBase64Image() This returns a base 64 encoded string of the chart in it's current state. myLineChart.toBase64Image(); // => returns png data url of the image on the canvas .getElementAtEvent(e) Calling getElementAtEvent(event) on your Chart instance passing an argument of an event, or jQuery event, will return the single element at the event position. If there are multiple items within range, only the first is returned. The value returned from this method is an array with a single parameter. An array is used to keep a consistent API between the get*AtEvent methods. myLineChart.getElementAtEvent(e); // => returns the first element at the event point. To get an item that was clicked on, getElementAtEvent can be used. function clickHandler(evt) { var firstPoint = myChart.getElementAtEvent(evt)[0]; if (firstPoint) { var label = myChart.data.labels[firstPoint._index]; var value = myChart.data.datasets[firstPoint._datasetIndex].data[firstPoint._index]; } } .getElementsAtEvent(e) Looks for the element under the event point, then returns all elements at the same data index. This is used internally for 'label' mode highlighting. Calling getElementsAtEvent(event) on your Chart instance passing an argument of an event, or jQuery event, will return the point elements that are at that the same position of that event. canvas.onclick = function(evt) { var activePoints = myLineChart.getElementsAtEvent(evt); // => activePoints is an array of points on the canvas that are at the same position as the click event. }; This functionality may be useful for implementing DOM based tooltips, or triggering custom behaviour in your application. .getDatasetAtEvent(e) Looks for the element under the event point, then returns all elements from that dataset. This is used internally for 'dataset' mode highlighting. myLineChart.getDatasetAtEvent(e); // => returns an array of elements .getDatasetMeta(index) Looks for the dataset that matches the current index and returns that metadata. This returned data has all of the metadata that is used to construct the chart. The data property of the metadata will contain information about each point, rectangle, etc. depending on the chart type. Extensive examples of usage are available in the Chart.js tests. var meta = myChart.getDatasetMeta(0); var x = meta.data[0].x; setDatasetVisibility(datasetIndex, visibility) Sets the visibility for a given dataset. This can be used to build a chart legend in HTML. During click on one of the HTML items, you can call setDatasetVisibility to change the appropriate dataset. chart.setDatasetVisibility(1, false); // hides dataset at index 1 chart.update(); // chart now renders with dataset hidden setDataVisibility(datasetIndex, index, visibility) Like setDatasetVisibility except that it hides only a single item in the dataset. Note this only applies to polar area and doughnut charts at the moment. It will have no affect on line, bar, radar, or scatter charts. chart.setDataVisibility(0, 2, false); // hides the item in dataset 0, at index 2 chart.update(); // chart now renders with item hidden toggleDataVisibility(index) Toggles the visibility of an item in all datasets. A dataset needs to explicitly support this feature for it to have an effect. From internal chart types, doughnut / pie and polar area use this. chart.toggleDataVisibility(2); // toggles the item in all datasets, at index 2 chart.update(); // chart now renders with item hidden getDataVisibility(index) Returns the stored visibility state of an data index for all datasets. Set by toggleDataVisibility. A dataset controller should use this method to determine if an item should not be visible. var visible = chart.getDataVisibility(2); hide(datasetIndex) Sets the visibility for the given dataset to false. Updates the chart and animates the dataset with 'hide' mode. This animation can be configured under the hide key in animation options. Please see animations docs for more details. chart.hide(1); // hides dataset at index 1 and does 'hide' animation. show(datasetIndex) Sets the visibility for the given dataset to true. Updates the chart and animates the dataset with 'show' mode. This animation can be configured under the show key in animation options. Please see animations docs for more details. chart.show(1); // shows dataset at index 1 and does 'show' animation.

When the chart data or options are changed, Chart.js will animate to the new data values and options. Adding or Removing Data Adding and removing data is supported by changing the data array. To add data, just add data into the data array as seen in this example. function addData(chart, label, data) { chart.data.labels.push(label); chart.data.datasets.forEach((dataset) => { dataset.data.push(data); }); chart.update(); } function removeData(chart) { chart.data.labels.pop(); chart.data.datasets.forEach((dataset) => { dataset.data.pop(); }); chart.update(); } Updating Options To update the options, mutating the options property in place or passing in a new options object are supported. If the options are mutated in place, other option properties would be preserved, including those calculated by Chart.js. If created as a new object, it would be like creating a new chart with the options - old options would be discarded. function updateConfigByMutating(chart) { chart.options.title.text = 'new title'; chart.update(); } function updateConfigAsNewObject(chart) { chart.options = { responsive: true, title: { display: true, text: 'Chart.js' }, scales: { x: { display: true }, y: { display: true } } }; chart.update(); } Scales can be updated separately without changing other options. To update the scales, pass in an object containing all the customization including those unchanged ones. Variables referencing any one from chart.scales would be lost after updating scales with a new id or the changed type. function updateScales(chart) { var xScale = chart.scales.x; var yScale = chart.scales.y; chart.options.scales = { newId: { display: true }, y: { display: true, type: 'logarithmic' } }; chart.update(); // need to update the reference xScale = chart.scales.newId; yScale = chart.scales.y; } You can also update a specific scale either by its id. function updateScale(chart) { chart.options.scales.y = { type: 'logarithmic' }; chart.update(); } Code sample for updating options can be found in toggle-scale-type.html.

"},"developers/plugins.html":{"url":"developers/plugins.html","title":"Plugins","keywords":"","body":"Plugins Plugins are the most efficient way to customize or change the default behavior of a chart. They have been introduced at version 2.1.0 (global plugins only) and extended at version 2.5.0 (per chart plugins and options). Using plugins Plugins can be shared between chart instances: var plugin = { /* plugin implementation */ }; // chart1 and chart2 use \"plugin\" var chart1 = new Chart(ctx, { plugins: [plugin] }); var chart2 = new Chart(ctx, { plugins: [plugin] }); // chart3 doesn't use \"plugin\" var chart3 = new Chart(ctx, {}); Plugins can also be defined directly in the chart plugins config (a.k.a. inline plugins): var chart = new Chart(ctx, { plugins: [{ beforeInit: function(chart, options) { //.. } }] }); However, this approach is not ideal when the customization needs to apply to many charts. Global plugins Plugins can be registered globally to be applied on all charts (a.k.a. global plugins): Chart.plugins.register({ // plugin implementation }); Note: inline plugins can't be registered globally. Configuration Plugin ID Plugins must define a unique id in order to be configurable. This id should follow the npm package name convention: can't start with a dot or an underscore can't contain any non-URL-safe characters can't contain uppercase letters should be something short, but also reasonably descriptive If a plugin is intended to be released publicly, you may want to check the registry to see if there's something by that name already. Note that in this case, the package name should be prefixed by chartjs-plugin- to appear in Chart.js plugin registry. Plugin options Plugin options are located under the options.plugins config and are scoped by the plugin ID: options.plugins.{plugin-id}. var chart = new Chart(ctx, { options: { foo: { ... }, // chart 'foo' option plugins: { p1: { foo: { ... }, // p1 plugin 'foo' option bar: { ... } }, p2: { foo: { ... }, // p2 plugin 'foo' option bla: { ... } } } } }); Disable plugins To disable a global plugin for a specific chart instance, the plugin options must be set to false: Chart.plugins.register({ id: 'p1', // ... }); var chart = new Chart(ctx, { options: { plugins: { p1: false // disable plugin 'p1' for this instance } } }); Plugin Core API Read more about the existing plugin extension hooks.

The default implementation handles the number of data points changing and creating elements appropriately. buildOrUpdateElements: function() {} } Extending Existing Chart Types Extending or replacing an existing controller type is easy. Simply replace the constructor for one of the built in types with your own. The built in controller types are: Chart.controllers.line Chart.controllers.bar Chart.controllers.horizontalBar Chart.controllers.radar Chart.controllers.doughnut Chart.controllers.polarArea Chart.controllers.bubble For example, to derive a new chart type that extends from a bubble chart, you would do the following. // Sets the default config for 'derivedBubble' to be the same as the bubble defaults. // We look for the defaults by doing Chart.defaults[chartType] // It looks like a bug exists when the defaults don't exist Chart.defaults.derivedBubble = Chart.defaults.bubble; // I think the recommend using Chart.controllers.bubble.extend({ extensions here }); var custom = Chart.controllers.bubble.extend({ draw: function(ease) { // Call super method first Chart.controllers.bubble.prototype.draw.call(this, ease); // Now we can do some custom drawing for this dataset.

To correctly calculate the width of a bar, the controller must determine the number of datasets that map to bars. To do this, the bar controller attaches a property bar to the dataset during initialization. If you are creating a replacement or updated bar controller, you should do the same. This will ensure that charts with regular bars and your new derived bars will work seamlessly.

It must be an object containing 2 properties: width and height. // You must set this.width to be the width and this.height to be the height of the scale fit: function() {}, // Draws the scale onto the canvas. this.(left|right|top|bottom) will have been populated to tell you the area on the canvas to draw in // @param chartArea : an object containing four properties: left, right, top, bottom. This is the rectangle that lines, bars, etc will be drawn in. It may be used, for example, to draw grid lines. draw: function(chartArea) {} } The Core.Scale base class also has some utility functions that you may find useful. { // Returns true if the scale instance is horizontal isHorizontal: function() {}, // Get the correct value from the value from this.chart.data.datasets[x].data[] // If dataValue is an object, returns .x or .y depending on the return of isHorizontal() // If the value is undefined, returns NaN // Otherwise returns the value. // Note that in all cases, the returned value is not guaranteed to be a number getRightValue: function(dataValue) {}, // Returns the scale tick objects ({label, major}) getTicks: function() {} } "},"developers/contributing.html":{"url":"developers/contributing.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing New contributions to the library are welcome, but we ask that you please follow these guidelines: Before opening a PR for major additions or changes, please discuss the expected API and/or implementation by filing an issue or asking about it in the Chart.js Slack #dev channel. This will save you development time by getting feedback upfront and make review faster by giving the maintainers more context and details. Consider whether your changes are useful for all users, or if creating a Chart.js plugin would be more appropriate. Check that your code will pass tests and eslint code standards. gulp test will run both the linter and tests for you. Add unit tests and document new functionality (in the test/ and docs/ directories respectively). Avoid breaking changes unless there is an upcoming major release, which are infrequent. We encourage people to write plugins for most new advanced features, and care a lot about backwards compatibility. We strongly prefer new methods to be added as private whenever possible. A method can be made private either by making a top-level function outside of a class or by prefixing it with _ and adding @private JSDoc if inside a class. Public APIs take considerable time to review and become locked once implemented as we have limited ability to change them without breaking backwards compatibility. Private APIs allow the flexibility to address unforeseen cases. Joining the project Active committers and contributors are invited to introduce yourself and request commit access to this project. We have a very active Slack community that you can join here. If you think you can help, we'd love to have you! Building and Testing Chart.js uses gulp to build the library into a single JavaScript file. Firstly, we need to ensure development dependencies are installed. With node and npm installed, after cloning the Chart.js repo to a local directory, and navigating to that directory in the command line, we can run the following: > npm install > npm install -g gulp-cli This will install the local development dependencies for Chart.js, along with a CLI for the JavaScript task runner gulp. The following commands are now available from the repository root: > gulp build // build dist files in ./dist > gulp build --watch // build and watch for changes > gulp unittest // run tests from ./test/specs > gulp unittest --watch // run tests and watch for source changes > gulp unittest --coverage // run tests and generate coverage reports in ./coverage > gulp lint // perform code linting (ESLint) > gulp test // perform code linting and run unit tests > gulp test --browsers ... // test with specified browsers (comma-separated) > gulp docs // build the documentation in ./dist/docs > gulp docs --watch // starts the gitbook live reloaded server More information can be found in gulpfile.js. Image-Based Tests Some display-related functionality is difficult to test via typical Jasmine units. For this reason, we introduced image-based tests (#3988 and #5777) to assert that a chart is drawn pixel-for-pixel matching an expected image. Generated charts in image-based tests should be as minimal as possible and focus only on the tested feature to prevent failure if another feature breaks (e.g. disable the title and legend when testing scales). You can create a new image-based test by following the steps below: Create a JS file (example) or JSON file (example) that defines chart config and generation options. Add this file in test/fixtures/{spec.name}/{feature-name}.json. Add a describe line to the beginning of test/specs/{spec.name}.tests.js if it doesn't exist yet. Run gulp unittest --watch --inputs=test/specs/{spec.name}.tests.js. Click the \"Debug\" button (top/right): a test should fail with the associated canvas visible. Right click on the chart and \"Save image as...\" test/fixtures/{spec.name}/{feature-name}.png making sure not to activate the tooltip or any hover functionality Refresh the browser page (CTRL+R): test should now pass Verify test relevancy by changing the feature values slightly in the JSON file. Tests should pass in both browsers. In general, we've hidden all text in image tests since it's quite difficult to get them passing between different browsers. As a result, it is recommended to hide all scales in image-based tests. It is also recommended to disable animations. If tests still do not pass, adjust tolerance and/or threshold at the beginning of the JSON file keeping them as low as possible. When a test fails, the expected and actual images are shown. If you'd like to see the images even when the tests pass, set \"debug\": true in the JSON file. Bugs and Issues Please report these on the GitHub page - at github.com/chartjs/Chart.js. Please do not use issues for support requests. For help using Chart.js, please take a look at the chartjs tag on Stack Overflow. Well structured, detailed bug reports are hugely valuable for the project. Guidelines for reporting bugs: Check the issue search to see if it has already been reported Isolate the problem to a simple test case Please include a demonstration of the bug on a website such as JS Bin, JS Fiddle, or Codepen. (Template). If filing a bug against master, you may reference the latest code via https://www.chartjs.org/dist/master/Chart.min.js (changing the filename to point at the file you need as appropriate). Do not rely on these files for production purposes as they may be removed at any time. Please provide any additional details associated with the bug, if it's browser or screen density specific, or only happens with a certain configuration or data.
